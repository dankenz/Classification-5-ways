# Classification-5-ways
5 strategies to detect fraud from a dataset.


Using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud it is possible to develop machine learning algoritms to predict if a given user is fraudulent or not. In this project 5 attempts are made, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and XGBoost gradient boosting. A brief explanation of every algoritm is made, as well as performace analisys.
