# Classification-5-ways
5 strategies to detect fraud from a dataset.


Using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud it is possible to develop machine learning algoritms to predict if a given user is fraudulent or not. In this project 5 attempts are made, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and XGBoost gradient boosting. A brief explanation of every algoritm is made, as well as performace analisys.

The dataset is too big for uploading here, but a smaller balanced sample is avaliable in 'Balanced_data.csv' as well as a 'balance_subsample.py' code that build this sample. For testing the original dataset is too big and I made a subsample_great.csv with 40k rows not balanced, the program is avaliable as well.
